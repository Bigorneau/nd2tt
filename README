Introduction:
-------------

nd2tt is a linux tool to record Diablo II gameplay and replay recordings in the 
game client. It's basically a modified and updated version of Gnarmock's D2TT 
with support for recording more than one client and replaying multiple 
recordings simultaneously.


Requirements:
-------------

	- wine
	- Diablo II
	- surgeon (or any other injector)


Installation:
-------------

$ ./compile [gcc options]

$ ./install [path]

The compile script will forward its first argument to gcc and compile src/nd2tt 
and src/module/nd2tt.so. install will copy nd2tt and nd2tt.so to path/bin and 
path/lib, respectively. $HOME/.nd2tt will be created as well.

NOTE: The path passed to installmust have a trailing '/'.
To configure the maximum amount of simultaneous connections to nd2tt, set 
IPC_MAX_CLIENTS in src/ipc/ipc.h accordingly before compiling.


Usage:
------

Inject nd2tt.so into every Diablo II client that you want to be able to record 
or replay

$ surgeon -i nd2tt.so [pid]

Proceed with starting nd2tt

$ nd2tt

nd2tt will load replay files from $HOME/.nd2tt/replays and eventually show you 
a prompt. The next section describes available commands.


Commands:
---------

	- quit/q will exit nd2tt
	- list clients/lc lists connected Diablo II clients
	- list replays/lr lists loaded replay files
	- record 'c'/r 'c' enables/disables recording for client 'c'
	- play 'c' 'r'/p 'c' 'r' play recording 'r' in client 'c'

NOTE: Arguments to record/play are indices of the corresponding listing.
